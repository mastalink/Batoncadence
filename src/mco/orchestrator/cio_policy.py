"""Deterministic policy checks for the claude-cio sidecar.

The sidecar itself is an LLM reading `ops/CIO_BRIEF.md` - free-form proposals
need judgment a fixed function cannot supply. But a handful of the brief's
rules ARE mechanical (a dollar figure against a cap, a category against a
prohibited list, "did the proposer also plan this"), and those are exactly
the rules an LLM under time pressure is most likely to round in its own
favor. This module makes them a function call instead of a vibe, so the
worker loop (or a test) can check a proposal the same way twice.

This is a policy boundary, not a dispatch adapter: it returns a verdict and
reasons, and never itself calls a notifier, the gateway, or Exchange.
